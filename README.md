## API Endpoints

## setup freshdesk webhook for tickets:

To receive real-time updates when a ticket is created or updated in Freshdesk, a webhook is manually configured under Admin > Workflows > Automations ->Ticket Updates, Ticket Creation. This webhook sends ticket data to the appâ€™s backend at /api/webhook/freshdesk and stored in the db . For full setup instructions, refer this Freshdesk's official webhook documentation.
